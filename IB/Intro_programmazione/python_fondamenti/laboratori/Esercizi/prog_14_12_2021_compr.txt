a - Create an identical list from the first list using list comprehension.
        lst1=[1,2,3,4,5]
        lst2= ???
        print(lst2)


b - Create a list from the elements of a range from 1200 to 2000 with steps of 130, using list comprehension.
        rng= ???
        lst=[]

c - Use list comprehension to contruct a new list but add 6 to each item.
        lst1=[44,54,64,74,104]
        lst2=[]
        print(lst2) 


d - Using list comprehension, construct a list from the squares of each element in the list.
        lst1=[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14]
        lst2=[]
        print(lst2)


e - Using list comprehension, construct a list from the squares of each element in the list, if the square is greater than 50.
        lst1=[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14]
        lst2=[]
